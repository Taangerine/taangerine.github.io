							<p class="topDescription">This project had us have our own Hackathon in class. In a Hackathon, programmers collaborate in order to create an app that
								has some significance and attempts to solve an issue or benefit users. Our group designed an instructive origami app designed to reduce stress. It did so
								by teaching origami, a known to be relaxing activity, in a simple and easy to understand way. The idea was to create something that allowed to user to reduce
								stress in a free, simple and accessible manner.
							</p>
							<h3> Impact on Me as a Student</h3>
							<p>This project helped to learn about workflows and the task of designing and creating something that is meant to be released to the public. Proper planning
								and an effective workflow is essential to doing this. The workflow we used here was GitHub and so this project helped me to further strengthen my
								understanding of how to use GitHub and the workflow it provides through the use of issues, pull requests and commits. This task required a heavy use of 
								HTML/CSS so I was also able to further strengthen my knowledge of that and gain a greater understanding of how to build a webpage and the process of doing such.

							</p>
							<h3>How Will I use this to Continue Learning?</h3>
							<p> I will use what I have learned to plan other projects and tasks better and to make accomodations for inconsistencies such as tasks taking longer than
								expected as this was an issue we ran into. I will continue to use GitHub and other workflows to accomplish tasks. Having now created a webpage, I can use what I have learned to gain more
								knowledge about web development and the possibilities that can be done.
