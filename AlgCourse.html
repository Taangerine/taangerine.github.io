							<p class="topDescription">This project required me and two others to create a course on teaching the basic concept of algorithms by teaching people
								how to solve a cubing puzzle. We decided to use the Pyraminx to do this.
							</p>
							<h3> Impact on Me as a Student</h3>
							<p>This assignment allowed me to get a deeper understanding of the fundamentals of an algorithm and the idea that at the core, it's simply a set of sets
								in order to accomplish a task or reach an endgoal. I was able to gain this understanding of a concept important to computer science without actually
								using it in a computer science context which can sometimes help to gain a different apprehension which strengthens the foundations for learning and using
								it in the given context. This is something that can apply to other school subjects and concepts. Sometimes, it can help to learn things about a concept
								in a perspective different to the main context as it can give you an understanding of the fundamentals and allows you to relate those findings to the 
								main concept which will reinforce understandings of said concept.
							</p>
							<h3>How Will I use this to Continue Learning?</h3>
							<p> Going back to the aforementioned idea of learning aspects of a concept outside of the central context, I will try and apply this idea to 
								my education to find new ways to learn that will enhance my understanding and ability to learn. I will use what I've learned about algorithms to further
								my understanding of algorithms and the different types that exist. I can apply this to my programs and use algorithms to code. I will use it to learn more
								about the different algorithms used in programs and apps that are used in many circumstances.
