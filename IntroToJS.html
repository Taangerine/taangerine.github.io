							<p class="topDescription">This module taught me about JavaScript and the basics of it as I didn't have much prior knowledge. It taught me in the
								context of making drawings and animations which made it more appealing to dive into and learn how to create.
							</p>
							<h3> Impact on Me as a Student</h3>
							<p> I learned about JavaScript syntax in this module which is a good contribution to my abilities and knowledge as a programmer. I was able to learn
								of different JavaScript practices and certain logic such as ternary, switches and loops. One thing I learned about was objects and object inheritance
								which I found quite useful as it helped me later on with the summative project where I had to refactor a coding challenge in an object-oriented way. 
								The module also helped me learn about creating graphics and visualizing things with Javascript. Another thing I learned is that by connecting something
								with something fun makes it more enjoyable and sometimes easier to learn which was done here as JavaScript was thought by using drawings and animations
								as the context.
							</p>
							<h3>How Will I use this to Continue Learning?</h3>

							<p> I will continue to use this in order to create more programs with JavaScript. Using libraries such as p5.js I will try to learn more about
								creating visual programs with JavaScript. I will use what I've learned about objects and inheritance in order to learn more about object-oriented 
								programming and how to be a more creative coder. I will be mindful of the practices I was taught here and to have clean, well commented, readable code.
								By completing this module that teaches the groundwork, I can build off of it in order to learn more about JavaScript and coding as a whole to become a better
								programmer. I will try and find ways to connect things I'm learning with fun in order to better learn the concept and make it more enjoyable.
