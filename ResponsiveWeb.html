							<p class="topDescription">This module taught me HTML and CSS from the basics of creating elements to the more detailed aspects to fine tune a website.
								
							</p>
							<h3> Impact on Me as a Student</h3>
							<p>The main thing that this taught me was HTML and CSS and how to build a webpage. I learned of many different things involving web development such as 
								media queries, flexboxes and grids. I also learned of different practices and habits when developing webpages such as providing alt text on images.
								One of the things I liked about freeCodeCamp is that its lessons were short, simple and to the point. It taught me what I needed to know without
								adding too much unnecessary explanations that would bore me or not make me want to continue, and I learned most of the HTML and CSS syntax I know
								from this module and it's easy for me to refer back to it when I forget something. From this I learned that a lot of the times, short and simple is
								the most effective teaching method.
							</p>
							<h3>How Will I use this to Continue Learning?</h3>
							<p> I will use what I've gained from this module to help me learn more about the wide world of web development. Now that I know the fundamentals, I'll
								be able to expand on it and gain new knowledge about web development, such as making pages interactive. After completing this module, I have created 
								a webpage as part of the Hackathon assignment and this is portfolio is also a webpage. Similar to how I have used what I've learned from this module
								to help make these webpages, I will continue to do the same and to expand my horizons. By also realizing the benefits of short and simple, if I have
								to teach someone something, I will keep that in mind that sometimes things are easier to understand when they're taught in a to the point matter.
